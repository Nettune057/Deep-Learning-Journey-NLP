# Series Natual Language Processing from Hero to Zero

## Day 1: Word2vec

Statistically-based vs Inference-based (word2vec) 

-> statistics : encoding the similarity of words, 
recompute them from the beginning when data are renewed

-> inference : similarity + encoding by identifying patterns between words, 
learn again with parameters when data are renewed 

- CBOW vs skip-gram

-> Word precision - skip-gram

-> Speed of learning - CBOW
